Markus says: 

> Your 75-minute lecture should be an introduction and should stimulate students' interest in learning more about the topic. No need to be exhaustive. If students want to get more complete training in Bayesian Statistics, they can take David Kaplan's class next fall (see email below and attached course announcement). Or read the [suggest reading] texts[.]
> 
> [By the way,] there is no need to present a lot of R code during lecture. If you feel it's the right thing to do we can plan on a lab exercise involving Bayesian statistics with R.
